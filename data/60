    "Warning messages may be displayed by Docker Engine when a user performs some actions, such as running docker info if the system kernel on a host system is configured to disable the net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables and net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables options. For example, the user may see an error similar to:",

Typically, enabling these options is not desirable as this can cause guest container traffic to be blocked by iptables rules that are intended for the host. This could cause unpredictable behavior for containers that do not expect traffic to be firewalled at the host level.",
