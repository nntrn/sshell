    "Digests",
    "Generating digests with the dgst option is one of the more straightforward tasks you can accomplish with the openssl binary. Producing digests is done so often, as a matter of fact, that you can find special-use binaries for doing the same thing.",

    "How do I create an MD5 or SHA1 digest of a file?",
    "Digests are created using the dgst option. Iâ€™ve seen several systems on which the OpenSSL dgst(1) man page does not accurately report the digest functions available via the local openssl binary. I suggest running openssl dgst -h to see which digests are actually available."
