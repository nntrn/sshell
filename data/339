    "The IFS variable - which stands for Internal Field Separator - controls what Bash calls word splitting. When set to a string, each character in the string is considered by Bash to separate words. This governs how bash will iterate through a sequence. ",
    "",
    "In the first for loop, IFS is set to $' '. (The $'...' syntax creates a string, with backslash-escaped characters replaced with special characters - like \"\\t\" for tab and \"\\n\" for newline.) Within the for loops, x and y are set to whatever bash considers a \"word\" in the original sequence. For the first loop, IFS is a space, meaning that words are separated by a space character. For the second loop, \"words\" are separated by a newline, which means bash considers the whole value of \"items\" as a single word. If IFS is more than one character, splitting will be done on any of those characters."
