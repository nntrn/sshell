    "Ports are a concept of UDP and TCP. Ping messages are technically referred to as ICMP Echo Request and ICMP Echo Reply which are part of ICMP. ICMP, TCP, and UDP are \"siblings\"; they are not based on each other, but are three separate protocols that run on top of IP.",

    "You can also use `telnet onofri.org 80`, as suggested in one of the other answers (It will give an error if the port is closed or filtered)."
