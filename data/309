    "`--aggressive`",
    "Usually *git gc* runs very quickly while providing good disk space utilization and performance. This option will cause *git gc* to more aggressively optimize the repository at the expense of taking much more time. The effects of this optimization are mostly persistent. See the \"AGGRESSIVE\" section below for details.",
    "",
    "`--auto`",
    "With this option, *git gc* checks whether any housekeeping is required; if not, it exits without performing any work.",
    "",
    "See the `gc.auto` option in the \"CONFIGURATION\" section below for how this heuristic works.",
    "",
    "Once housekeeping is triggered by exceeding the limits of configuration options such as `gc.auto` and `gc.autoPackLimit`, all other housekeeping tasks (e.g. rerere, working trees, reflog...​) will be performed as well.",
    "",
    "`--prune=<date>`",
    "Prune loose objects older than date (default is 2 weeks ago, overridable by the config variable `gc.pruneExpire`). --prune=now prunes loose objects regardless of their age and increases the risk of corruption if another process is writing to the repository concurrently; see \"NOTES\" below. --prune is on by default.",
    "",
    "`--no-prune`",
    "Do not prune any loose objects.",
    "",
    "`--quiet`",
    "Suppress all progress reports.",
    "",
    "`--force`",
    "Force `git gc` to run even if there may be another `git gc` instance running on this repository.",
    "",
    "`--keep-largest-pack`",
    "All packs except the largest pack and those marked with a `.keep` files are consolidated into a single pack. When this option is used, `gc.bigPackThreshold` is ignored."
