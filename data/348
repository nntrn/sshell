  "description": "This directive allows you to prevent the use of all HTTP methods, except the ones that you explicitly allow. Within a location block, you may want to restrict the use of some HTTP methods, such as forbidding clients from sending POST requests. You need to define two elements: first, the methods that are not forbidden (the allowed methods; all others will be forbidden); and second, the audience that is affected by the restriction",
