    "The OpenSSL developers have built a benchmarking suite directly into the `openssl` binary. It's accessible via the `speed` option. It tests how many operations it can perform in a given time, rather than how long it takes to perform a given number of operations. This strikes me as quite sane, because the benchmarks don't take significantly longer to run on a slow system than on a fast one.",
