    "-   More ansible facts will be added with successive releases. If facter or ohai are installed, variables from these programs will also be snapshotted into the JSON file for usage in temserver. These variables are prefixed with facter_ and ohai_ so it's easy to tell their source. All variables are bubbled up to the caller. Using the ansible facts and choosing to not install facter and ohai means you can avoid Ruby-dependencies on your remote systems. (See also facter and ohai.)",

    "-   If the target host is Windows you can now use facserver. Make sure that this path exists on the target host. Files in this path MUST be PowerShell scripts (*.ps1) and their output must be formattable in JSON (Ansible will take care of this). Test the output of your scripts. This option was added in Ansible 2.1.",
    "-   This module is also supported for Windows targets.",
    "-   This module should be run with elevated privileges on BSD systems to gather facts like ansserver."
