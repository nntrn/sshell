## Description

If you added the files and then removed them, the blobs still exist but are dangling. git fsck will list unreachable blobs, and git prune will delete them.

If you added the files, committed them, and then rolled back with `git reset --hard HEAD^`, they’re stuck a little deeper. `git fsck` will not list any dangling commits or blobs, because your branch’s reflog is holding onto them. 

Here’s one way to ensure that only objects which are in your history proper will remain:

git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git repack -ad  # Remove dangling objects from packfiles
git prune       # Remove dangling loose objects

Another way is also to clone the repository, as that will only carry the objects which are reachable. However, if the dangling objects got packed (and if you performed many operations, git may well have packed automatically), then a local clone will carry the entire packfile:

git clone foo bar                 # bad
git clone --no-hardlinks foo bar  # also bad

You must specify a protocol to force git to compute a new pack:

git clone file://foo bar  # good
