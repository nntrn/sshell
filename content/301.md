## Description

Search for files in your home directory which have been modified in the last twenty-four hours. 
This command works this way because the time since each file was last modified is divided by 24 hours and any remainder is discarded. 
That means that to match -mtime 0, a file will have to have a modification in the past which is less than 24 hours ago.

## Code

```bash
find $HOME -mtime 0
```

<!-- end -->
