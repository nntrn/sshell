## Description

${!prefix*}
${!prefix@}

Names matching prefix.  

Expands to the names of variables whose names begin with prefix, separated by the first character of the IFS special variable.  

When @ is used and the expansion appears within double quotes, each variable name expands to a separate word.

## Code

```bash
${!prefix*}
${!prefix@}
```

## Example

```
$ echo "${!VAULT*}"
VAULT_ADDR VAULT_NAMESPACE VAULT_TOKEN
```

<!-- end -->
