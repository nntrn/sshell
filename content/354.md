## Description

$ man openssl-dgst

  The digest mechanisms that are available will depend on the options used when building
  OpenSSL.  The list digest-commands command can be used to list them.

  New or agile applications should use probably use SHA-256. Other digests, particularly
  SHA-1 and MD5, are still widely used for interoperating with existing formats and
  protocols.

  When signing a file, dgst will automatically determine the algorithm (RSA, ECC, etc) to
  use for signing based on the private key's ASN.1 info.  When verifying signatures, it
  only handles the RSA, DSA, or ECDSA signature itself, not the related data to identify
  the signer and algorithm used in formats such as x.509, CMS, and S/MIME.

  A source of random numbers is required for certain signing algorithms, in particular
  ECDSA and DSA.

  The signing and verify options should only be used if a single file is being signed or
  verified.

  Hex signatures cannot be verified using openssl.  Instead, use "xxd -r" or similar
  program to transform the hex signature into a binary signature prior to verification.

## Code

```bash
echo -n "$salt$password" | openssl dgst -r -sha1
```

## Example

```
$ salt=salt
$ password=password
$ echo -n "$salt$password" | openssl dgst -r -sha1

```
