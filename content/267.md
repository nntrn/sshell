## Description

Comparing the Synopsys of the two main and recent versions of OpenSSL, let me quote the man pages.

OpenSSL 1.1.0
openssl enc -ciphername [-help] [-ciphers] [-in filename] [-out filename] [-pass arg] [-e] [-d] [-a/-base64] [-A] [-k password] [-kfile filename] [-K key] [-iv IV] [-S salt] [-salt] [-nosalt] [-z] [-md digest] [-p] [-P] [-bufsize number] [-nopad] [-debug] [-none] [-engine id]
OpenSSL 1.1.1
openssl enc -cipher [-help] [-ciphers] [-in filename] [-out filename] [-pass arg] [-e] [-d] [-a] [-base64] [-A] [-k password] [-kfile filename] [-K key] [-iv IV] [-S salt] [-salt] [-nosalt] [-z] [-md digest] [-iter count] [-pbkdf2] [-p] [-P] [-bufsize number] [-nopad] [-debug] [-none] [-rand file...] [-writerand file] [-engine id]
There obviously are some greater differences, namely considering this question, there are these two switches missing in the 1.1.0:

pbkdf2

iter

You have basically two options now. Either ignore the warning or adjust your encryption command to something like:

openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -md sha512 -pbkdf2 -iter 100000 -salt -in InputFilePath -out OutputFilePath
Where these switches:

-aes-256-cbc is what you should use for maximum protection or the 128-bit version, the 3DES (Triple DES) got abandoned some time ago, see Triple DES has been deprecated by NIST in 2017, while AES gets accelerated by all modern CPUs by a lot; you can simply verify if your CPU has the AES-NI instruction set for example using grep aes /proc/cpuinfo; win, win

-md sha512 is the faster variant of SHA-2 functions family compared to SHA-256 while it might be a bit more secure; win, win

-pbkdf2: use PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) algorithm

-iter 100000 is overriding the default count of iterations for the password, quoting the man page:
Use a given number of iterations on the password in deriving the encryption key. High values increase the time required to brute-force the resulting file. This option enables the use of PBKDF2 algorithm to derive the key.

## Code

```bash
ENCRYPTEDFILE=.secrets.enc
SALTFILE=.vault-password
SECRETSFILE=.env

# encrypt
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -md sha512 -pbkdf2 -iter 100000 -base64 -salt -in $SECRETSFILE -out $ENCRYPTEDFILE -pass file:$SALTFILE

# decrypt
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -md sha512 -pbkdf2 -iter 100000 -base64 -salt -in $ENCRYPTEDFILE -pass file:$SALTFILE
```
