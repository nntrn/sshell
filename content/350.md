## Description

MemAvailable is the best estimation and has built-in heuristics
around reclaimable memory.  However, it is not available until 3.14
kernel (i.e. Ubuntu LTS Trusty misses it).  In that case, we fall
back to free+buffers+cache as the available memory.

## Code

```bash
awk '/^MemAvailable:/ {print $2}' /proc/meminfo
```

<!-- end -->
