## Description

In the Bash shell, the ${!prefix@} parameter expansion generates all variables that start with prefix.

${!prefix@} Expands to the names of variables whose names begin with prefix [...] When @ is used and the expansion appears within double quotes, each variable name expands to a separate word.

This list can then be passed to unset:

unset "${!myvarname@}"

## Code

```bash
unset "${!VSCODE@}"
```

<!-- end -->
