## Description

These simple commands give you a feel of the memory usage and give the first indication that you have a memory leak when you see that the Rss of a process keeps on increasing. However, they are not very accurate in the absolute measurements of memory usage.

## Code

```bash
ps -eo pid,tid,class,rtprio,stat,vsz,rss,comm
```

<!-- end -->
