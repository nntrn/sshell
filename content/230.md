## Description

'${PARAMETER:OFFSET:LENGTH}'
     This is referred to as Substring Expansion.  It expands to up to
     LENGTH characters of the value of PARAMETER starting at the
     character specified by OFFSET.  If PARAMETER is '@', an indexed
     array subscripted by '@' or '*', or an associative array name, the
     results differ as described below.  If LENGTH is omitted, it
     expands to the substring of the value of PARAMETER starting at the
     character specified by OFFSET and extending to the end of the
     value.  LENGTH and OFFSET are arithmetic expressions (*note Shell
     Arithmetic::).

     If OFFSET evaluates to a number less than zero, the value is used
     as an offset in characters from the end of the value of PARAMETER.
     If LENGTH evaluates to a number less than zero, it is interpreted
     as an offset in characters from the end of the value of PARAMETER
     rather than a number of characters, and the expansion is the
     characters between OFFSET and that result.  Note that a negative
     offset must be separated from the colon by at least one space to
     avoid being confused with the ':-' expansion.

## Code

```bash
$ set -- 01234567890abcdefgh

$ echo ${1:7}
7890abcdefgh
$ echo ${1:7:0}

$ echo ${1:7:2}
78

$ echo ${1:7:-2}
7890abcdef

$ echo ${1: -7}
bcdefgh

$ echo ${1: -7:0}

$ echo ${1: -7:2}
bc

$ echo ${1: -7:-2}
bcdef
```

<!-- end -->
