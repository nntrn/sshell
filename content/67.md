## Description

The '*' metacharacter represents zero or more instances of the
   previous expression. The '*' metacharacter looks for the leftmost
   possible match first and will match zero characters. Thus,

## Code

```bash
echo foo | sed 's/o*/EEE/'
```

## Example

```
$ echo foo | sed 's/o*/EEE/'
EEEfoo
```

## Output

```
will generate 'EEEfoo', not 'fEEE' as one might expect. This is because /o*/ matches the null string at the beginning of the word.
```
