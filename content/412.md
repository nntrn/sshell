## Description

Manual delete
First, you have to flush and rotate the log files. Rotating is a way of marking the current active log files as an archive and creating a fresh logfile from this moment. The flush switch asks the journal daemon to flush any log data stored in /run/log/journal/ into /var/log/journal/, if persistent storage is enabled.

Then, after flushing and rotating, you need to run journalctl with vacuum-size, vacuum-time, and vacuum-files switches to force systemd to clear the logs. 

## Code

```bash
# retain logs from last <N>[s,m,h,days,months,weeks,years]
journalctl --flush --rotate
journalctl --vacuum-time=10days

# retains the last 400MB files.
journalctl --flush --rotate
journalctl --vacuum-size=400M

# retains last 2 files
journalctl --flush --rotate
journalctl --vacuum-files=2
```
