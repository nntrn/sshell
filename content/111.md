## Description

What exec cmd does, is exactly the same as just running cmd, except that the current shell is replaced with the command, instead of a separate process being run.

## Code

```bash
bash -c 'echo $$ ; exec ls -l /proc/self ; echo foo'
```

## Example

```
$ bash -c 'echo $$ ; exec ls -l /proc/self ; echo foo'
4315
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Aug 17 09:15 /proc/self -> 4315
```

<!-- end -->
