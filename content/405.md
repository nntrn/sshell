## Description

Using netstat for Open Ports Scan
Enter the following command as root to determine which ports are listening for connections from the network:

~]# netstat -pan -A inet,inet6 | grep -v ESTABLISHED

Use the -l option of the netstat command to display only listening server sockets:
~]# netstat -tlnw

## Code

```bash
netstat -pan -A inet,inet6 | grep -v ESTABLISHED
```

<!-- end -->
