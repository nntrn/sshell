## Description

-amin, -atime, -cmin, -ctime, -mmin, and -mtime

-atime n
File was last accessed n*24 hours ago.  When find figures out how many 24-hour periods ago the file was last accessed, any fractional part is ignored, so to match -atime +1, a file  has to have been accessed at least two days ago. 

-ctime n
File's status was last changed n*24 hours ago. 

## Code

```bash
find . -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -ctime 0 -print
```

<!-- end -->
